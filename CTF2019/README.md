# Expertcactus and Nuclearfarmboy proudly present:
# The first _ExpertNuclearCactusFarmboy Capture the Flag for Hackers and People Who Like to do Other Stuff Too!_

## The Story:

Sometimes CTF's are hard and over your head. Sometimes they are complicated and over the top. Sometimes you want to do a CTF that is more your speed with your good friends Expertcactus and Nuclearfarmboy. 

So knowing this, we realized we wanted to do a CTF that was focused on learning, getting people excited about hacking and learning more about computers, but most importantly fun and not super intimidating to newcomers to the field. 

#### So we pitched the idea to friends and fellow SFS students and here we are!

The concept is simple: follow instructions, find flags, submit the flags to us via twitter DM, email, or a message and we will update the score at

## The Challenges:

There are 3 categories. 

**Reverse Engineering || Linux || Binary Exploit**

Each category will have 4 challenges ranging from super easy (worth 1 point) to more challenging (worth 4 points)

The instructions are provided for each challenge in the respective folder and on the website http://nuclearfarmboy.com/ctf2019

## Winning

Solve all the problems. First one to solve them all wins!

Alternatively, we will see who has the most points one week after posting, and declare them the Winner, first person to solve them all after that will be colloquially and unironically referred to as **Champ**.
